        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Game Overview</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>Neon Rising</strong> is a dynamic vertical platformer developed in Unity using C#. It features a complete narrative in which the protagonist must ascend to confront the person who murdered their father in childhood. The player uses a bow not only as a weapon but also as a teleportation tool, allowing creative mobility through levels filled with enemies and platform challenges. Almost all assets, from sprites to background environments and interface elements, were handcrafted by me.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> C#</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity Editor (no external plugins)</li>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Core Architecture</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          The game is structured around a modular manager-based architecture to handle core systems such as audio, UI, level control, and procedural content. The game contains two fixed levels (tutorial and a main level) designed manually for precision gameplay and story pacing. In addition, there is a fully procedural game mode where platforms and enemy configurations are generated dynamically. Game logic is component-driven and follows clear separation of concerns between player input, physics, collision, and UI.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Bow mechanics:</strong> switch between combat arrow and teleport arrow modes</li>
          <li><strong>Teleportation:</strong> instantly move to the arrowâ€™s impact point</li>
          <li><strong>Dash:</strong> fast movement in the direction of the mouse</li>
          <li><strong>Platform variety:</strong> solid, grates, clouds (disappearing), moving platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Enemies:</strong> various enemy types plus a final boss</li>
          <li><strong>Vertical camera constraint:</strong> players must climb fast enough or lose</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Game Loop & Progression</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          The player progresses through a vertically scrolling level, evading or defeating enemies using arrow types. The camera scrolls upward at a constant rate, forcing the player to ascend continuously. If the player falls below the camera view or touches a lethal trap/enemy, the level resets. The game begins with a tutorial level, followed by the main fixed level which concludes in a boss battle. For extended gameplay and replayability, a procedural mode offers new challenges in each session. A full run typically lasts between 20 and 45 minutes.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Development Context</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          This was my first full game development project, carried out as part of a university course. The team originally consisted of six people, but after the first week one member left the degree, and the workload was redistributed among the remaining five. I was responsible for the procedural level generation system and the complete functionality of the platforming mechanics. In addition, I created most of the visual assets, including characters, interface elements, and background environments.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          This experience was a turning point for me. I learned core programming practices in C#, how to manage partial team loss under time pressure, and how to adapt iteratively while delivering a functional game. It also taught me the importance of structuring game logic modularly and anticipating edge cases when designing player interaction systems.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Guerrilla Showcase</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          In 2023, we showcased <strong>Neon Rising</strong> at the Guerrilla event hosted at our university. The game received an excellent reception from attendees, and we gathered insightful feedback from players and professionals alike. It was a motivating experience that highlighted the strengths of our design and helped us reflect on areas for improvement.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Telemetry & Game Analytics</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          We are currently collaborating with a new group to develop a telemetry system for games. This system is already being integrated into <strong>Neon Rising</strong> to monitor metrics such as level complexity, player behavior, and the effectiveness of enemy types. The data allows us to balance gameplay, refine enemy placement, and ensure difficulty scales appropriately. It's a practical tool that enhances the development process through measurable insights.
